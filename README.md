# MonthlyBudget

This program helps users to manage their budget for the current month. 
They can input description and amount of income/expense to the input box,
and the new item will be added to the list at the bottom. 
At the top, the budget will be calculated and updated every time a user inputs or deletes item.
Users can also view the total monthly income and expense. 
Each expense item shows the percentage of how much that expense is for the total income.
